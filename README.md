## Welcome!

These are my solutions to the bronze problems found in the December 2023 contest! (Uploaded post-contest)
- All solutions are written in java
- Formatted using standard I/O using `BufferedReader` and `StringTokenizer` classes

## Key File Notes

- `_solution`: These are the solutions that I wrote after the contest end, files that don't have this I wrote during the contest, and if there isn't a "solution" for one question, that just means i got full credit.
