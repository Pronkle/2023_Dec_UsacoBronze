## Welcome!

These are my solutions to the bronze problems found in the December 2023 contest! (Uploaded post-contest)
- All solutions are written in java
- Formatted using standard I/O using `BufferedReader` and `StringTokenizer` classes

## Key File Notes

- `_solution`: These are the solutions that I wrote after the contest end, files that don't have this I wrote during the contest, and if there isn't a "solution" for one question, that just means i got full credit. 

## Notes About Problems

1. ## Candy Cane Feast
- This one is in my opinion the easiest problem of this season, really just a straight foward simulation

2. ## Cowntact Tracing
- This one was certainly the hardest problem in my opinion, a lot of thinking and mechanics that you need to be familiar with
- Also note that there are a couple of ways to approach this problem, but best way through a window method

3. ## Farmer John Actually Farms
- I think that this problem, looks very intimidating, but if you read and work out the cases, it is alright. This one mainly just focused on a few mechanics, and you just need to run a post-test afterwards, see `farmerjohnfarms_solution.java` for a working version of the code.

## Additional Notes
1. Pay ATTENTION TO USING LONGS OR INTEGERS! (These kind of notes are often included on the problem pages already)
